            <h2>About this recipe</h2> 
                <p>This recipe was made by me during my long stay at Fort Benning,
                    Georgia, while I was awaiting my secondary training. I had never 
                    liked cottage cheese up unti then, but then I realized how protein 
                    packed it was! Cottage cheese itself was too boring, so I added 
                    ingredients progressively in order to create a sort of breakfast
                    monstrosity...1-2 servings</p>

            <h2> Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup Cottage Cheese (Preffered percentage)</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp crunchy peanut butter</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp Nestle Toll House 63% Dark Chocolate Morsels </li>
                    <li>1 banana</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup raspberries</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
