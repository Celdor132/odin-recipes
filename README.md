 Project Goals: This is my first project under The Odin Project criteria. It will be used to establish my initial HTML Skills, such as: creating and managing files and directories, use of GitHub and Visual Studio Code, and solidifying my use of the multitude of Ubuntu Linux commands.

Project Self-Reflection: Use of HTML is fairly intuitive, and I learned a few handy tricks along the way, such as linking to previous pages, back to top of pages, and adding captions to figures. I am now moving into CSS to learn to style projects.
