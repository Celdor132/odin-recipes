# odin-recipes
 Project Goals: 
    This is my first project under The Odin Project criteria. It will be used to etablish my initial HTML Skills, such as: creating and managing files and directories, use of GitHub and Visual Studio Code, and solidifying my use of the multitude of Ubuntu Linux commands.

Project Self-Reflection: THis was a good first step into HTML. I learned a few helpful tricks, such as an easy way to create 'Return to...' links and buttons. 
I will be continously updating this project throughout my time on TOP. I am now moving into the CSS training, and will be using this Odin Recipes as a test subject.
